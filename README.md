### Date created
On April 1st, 2023, I created this project and README file.

### Project Title
The Project Title would be Bike Sharing in New York City

### Description
According to the Udacity website (https://learn.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd104-bmann-employees/parts/cd0024/lessons/ls1727/concepts/13e9716e-5c9f-4fc8-af94-8b79cc9c15b4), this project is about: Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day. In this project, you will use data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. You will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

### Files used
The data files that will be used are downloaded from https://citibikenyc.com/system-data
